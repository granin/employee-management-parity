# Employee Management Parity Report – Build 9o205nrhz (07 Oct 2025)

This report captures the current state of the employee-management parity demo (`https://employee-management-parity-9o205nrhz-granins-projects.vercel.app`) versus the live WFM Employees module. It replaces the legacy sigma-eight write-up. Use it alongside the comprehensive validation log (`~/Desktop/2025-10-07_09-00_comprehensive-validation-report.markdown`).

## Verified Parity
- **Employee list & navigation** – Table layout, toolbar icons (display settings → tags → import → export → columns → new employee), selection mode, dismissed toggle, chip counter, and navigation labels all mirror production without “демо” suffixes.
- **Edit drawer** – Required/optional blocks, scheme history, dismiss/restore workflow, task timeline badges, and quick-add intro match CH3 documentation.
- **Quick add** – Login/password entry immediately opens the edit drawer with seeded defaults and timeline entries.
- **Bulk edit matrix** – Status, team, hour norm, work scheme, skills, reserve skills, tags, and comments apply across the selection; comments append to timelines with the correct source labels. Tag actions respect the four-tag cap. Summary panel surfaces the planned changes alongside a scrollable selection list with total count.
- **Import / Export** – CSV export respects visible columns and selection; import modals validate file extension, empty files, and required headers for Теги/Отпуска/Сотрудника/Навыки/Схемы (Appendix 1/3/4/6/8), surfacing success/error toasts via `aria-live`. Headings/descriptions now match the chosen context and filenames use WFM-style prefixes.
- **Persistence & validation** – Drawer saves persist via localStorage with confirmation toast, save button remains disabled until email/phone/hour norm pass validation, and tag catalogue changes survive refresh.
- **Playwright regression** – Automated coverage includes selection workflows, dismiss/restore, quick add, bulk edit (tags/skills/reserve add/replace/remove), tag limit errors, import validation (invalid + valid) across all templates, validation gating, persistence after reload, tag catalogue retention, and summary panel assertions.

## Remaining Gaps (tracked post-Phase 5)
- **NVDA sweep** – VoiceOver pass complete; schedule NVDA to confirm parity on Windows hardware and append results to the handoff doc.
- **Evidence refresh** – Capture fresh screenshots (selection banner, dismiss/restore timeline, tag alerts) and archive pre-Oct 07 Desktop reports.

## Recommended Actions
1. Schedule NVDA smoke test and log findings in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` / parity plan.
2. Update `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`, `docs/EMPLOYEE_MANAGEMENT_PARITY_PLAN.md`, and `docs/Archive/` with fresh captures + links to the latest Desktop analyses.
3. Coordinate with backend owners on edit persistence & export category integration once parity passes 95 % (UI now mirrors expected behaviour via local storage).
