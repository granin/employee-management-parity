# Employee Management Parity Report – Build 9o205nrhz (07 Oct 2025)

This report captures the current state of the employee-management parity demo (`https://employee-management-parity-9o205nrhz-granins-projects.vercel.app`) versus the live WFM Employees module. It replaces the legacy sigma-eight write-up. Use it alongside the comprehensive validation log (`~/Desktop/2025-10-07_09-00_comprehensive-validation-report.markdown`).

## Verified Parity
- **Employee list & navigation** – Table layout, toolbar icons (display settings → tags → import → export → columns → new employee), selection mode, dismissed toggle, chip counter, and navigation labels all mirror production without “демо” suffixes.
- **Edit drawer** – Required/optional blocks, scheme history, dismiss/restore workflow, task timeline badges, and quick-add intro match CH3 documentation.
- **Quick add** – Login/password entry immediately opens the edit drawer with seeded defaults and timeline entries.
- **Bulk edit matrix** – Status, team, hour norm, work scheme, skills, reserve skills, tags, and comments apply across the selection; comments append to timelines with the correct source labels. Tag actions respect the four-tag cap.
- **Import / Export** – CSV export respects visible columns and selection; import modals validate file extension, empty files, and required headers for Теги/Отпуска, surfacing success/error toasts via `aria-live`.
- **Playwright regression** – Automated coverage includes selection workflows, dismiss/restore, quick add, bulk edit (tags/skills/reserve), tag limit errors, and import validation (invalid + valid TSV).

## Remaining Gaps (tracked in Phase 4)
- **Accessibility sweep** – NVDA/VoiceOver pass outstanding for filters, bulk edit, tag manager, import/export, quick add, and edit drawer. Focus trapping is in place, but screen-reader output must be verified and documented.
- **Bulk edit coverage** – Playwright still needs scenarios for skills/reserve add/remove, plus any edge cases around combined actions.
- **Import templates** – Required-header checks exist for Теги/Отпуска; employees/skills/schemes templates should be double-checked (and tests added where feasible).
- **Persistence note** – UI remains front-end only; add documentation warning until API integration lands.
- **Evidence refresh** – Capture fresh screenshots (selection banner, dismiss/restore timeline, tag alerts) and archive pre-Oct 07 Desktop reports.

## Recommended Actions
1. Execute the full accessibility sweep, logging results and patches in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and the parity plan.
2. Extend Playwright coverage per the remaining bulk-edit/import scenarios and keep `tests/employee-list.spec.ts` authoritative.
3. Update `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`, `docs/EMPLOYEE_MANAGEMENT_PARITY_PLAN.md`, and `docs/Archive/` with new captures + links to the latest Desktop analyses.
4. Coordinate with backend owners on edit persistence & export category integration once parity passes 95 %.
