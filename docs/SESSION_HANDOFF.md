# Employee Management Parity – Session Handoff

- Repository: `~/git/client/employee-management-parity` (actively deployed to Vercel project `employee-management-parity`).
- Current state (Phases 1–4 shipped, Phase 5 stabilization in progress): row clicks open the edit drawer, selection mode mirrors WFM, bulk-edit matrix covers add/replace/remove for skills/reserve/tags, tag manager remains global, import/export validate Appendix 1/3/4/6/8 headers, task timelines capture bulk/system notes, employee edits now persist via localStorage with success toast/error handling, edit drawer validations gate “Сохранить изменения”, tag catalogue survives refreshes, and the bulk-edit drawer exposes a scrollable selection list with a planned-changes summary block.
- Latest production deploy: `https://employee-management-parity-9o205nrhz-granins-projects.vercel.app` (run `vercel deploy --prod --yes` from this repo for future releases).
- Evidence store: Desktop reports (`~/Desktop/2025-10-06_*.md`, `~/Desktop/2025-10-07_09-00_comprehensive-validation-report.markdown`), CH3/CH5/CH7 manuals, screenshot library (`docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`).
- Local verification this session: `npm run build`, `npm run test -- --reporter=list --project=chromium --workers=1` (32/32 passing; covers validation gating, persistence after reload, tag-catalogue retention, dynamic modal headings, and bulk-edit summary assertions).

## 2. Required Reading Before Implementation
1. `docs/EMPLOYEE_MANAGEMENT_PARITY_PLAN.md` – roadmap/evidence inventory.
2. `docs/Tasks/parity-backlog-and-plan.md` – backlog & phase sequencing.
3. `docs/PRD_STATUS.md` – status of all PRDs; review `docs/SOP/prd-feedback-sop.md` for the conversion workflow.
4. `docs/SOP/ui-walkthrough-checklist.md` – validation steps (focus traps, matrix actions, exports, timeline checks).
5. Browser-agent parity report (`docs/AGENT_PARITY_REPORT.md`) and the latest bb audit on Desktop.
6. Required manuals/screenshots (CH3 Employees, CH5 Schedule*, CH7 Appendices, `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`).
7. Phase 5 PRD (`docs/Tasks/phase-5-stabilization-and-validation-prd.md`) plus Phase 4 retro (`docs/Tasks/phase-4-accessibility-and-final-parity.md`) for detailed next steps.
8. `docs/TODO_AGENT.md` for focused follow-up items and command reminders.

## 3. Snapshot of Current Code
- `App.tsx`: Seeds employees with structured `EmployeeTask` timelines and work-scheme history samples, registers a global helper for quick-add (used by tests), and syncs employee mutations to localStorage so drawer saves persist across reloads.
- `EmployeeListContainer.tsx`: Production-style grid with filters (Esc shortcut), selection-mode toggle, dismiss/restore workflow, always-enabled tag manager, column settings, CSV/Отпуска/Теги exports, add/replace/remove matrix actions, tag-cap enforcement (≤4), import validation covering Appendix 1/3/4/6/8 headers, focus restoration for every overlay trigger, context-aware import/export headings, tag catalogue persistence, and a bulk-edit summary panel + scrollable selection list with total count.
- `EmployeeEditDrawer.tsx`: Required/optional sections aligned with CH3; dismiss/restore controls append system timeline badges alongside manual/bulk edits; scheme history section renders read-only timeline of assignments; skill/reserve summaries reflect bulk changes immediately; save button disables until email/phone/hour norm validations pass, emits “Сохранено” toast, and shows inline errors; close button exposes a stable test id.
- `QuickAddEmployee.tsx`: Minimal login/password flow with validation, shared focus trap, labelled dialog semantics, and timeline defaults built via a shared task helper.
- `src/hooks/useFocusTrap.ts`: Shared trap utility used across all overlays (bulk edit, tag manager, column settings, quick add, edit drawer).
- `src/utils/task.ts`: Shared helper for timeline entries (manual/bulk/system sources).
- Tests (`tests/employee-list.spec.ts`): cover row/drawer parity, dismiss/restore, quick-add accessibility, tag export download, selection-mode entry, tag limit enforcement, bulk edit skills/reserve add/remove/replace, import validation (extension + header negative/positive) for employees/skills/schemes/tags/vacations, plus new checks for drawer validation gating, persistence after reload, tag catalogue retention, dynamic import/export headings, and bulk-edit summary output.
- Deploy script is manual via Vercel CLI; ensure build/test succeed before promoting.

## 4. Evidence Checklist (complete before new work)
- [ ] Parity plan & backlog reviewed (`docs/EMPLOYEE_MANAGEMENT_PARITY_PLAN.md`, `docs/Tasks/parity-backlog-and-plan.md`).
- [ ] PRD index inspected (`docs/PRD_STATUS.md`); confirm which PRD you are updating/creating.
- [ ] Latest browser-agent output/bb report triaged; conflicts noted.
- [ ] Relevant manuals/screenshots opened for reference.
- [ ] SOPs consulted (`docs/SOP/prd-feedback-sop.md`, `docs/SOP/standard-operating-procedures.md`, `docs/SOP/ui-walkthrough-checklist.md`).

## 5. Implementation TODO (Forward Plan)
1. **NVDA sweep**: secure Windows access, mirror the VoiceOver lap, and append findings to `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, the Phase 5 PRD, and the parity plan.
2. **Screenshot backlog**: capture selection banner / dismiss timeline / tag-limit alert, register filenames in `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`, and update archive banners.
3. **Phase 5 follow-up**: coordinate with product/backend on long-term persistence + validation expectations once NVDA signs off; keep `docs/Tasks/phase-5-stabilization-and-validation-prd.md` in sync.
4. **Agent loop**: after each slice, rerun the walkthrough, update PRDs/status index, and drop verification notes in this handoff.

## 6. Working Agreement
- Every new browser-agent delta must flow through `docs/SOP/prd-feedback-sop.md`: update or create PRD, log status (`docs/PRD_STATUS.md`), and document evidence in the PRD.
- Keep `docs/SOP/ui-walkthrough-checklist.md` and screenshot index aligned with UI changes.
- Run `npm run build` and `npm run test -- --reporter=list --project=chromium --workers=1` locally before committing or deploying.
- Only run `npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4174` when requested by the repo owner; stop the server once checks finish.
- Document deployments (URL + purpose) in this handoff and/or parity plan.
- Maintain a quick VoiceOver (Chrome) lap after overlay changes: toolbar → Filters (Esc) → Mass edit → Tag manager (limit warning) → Import (error + success) → Quick add cancel → Edit drawer dismiss/restore.

## 7. Contact & Escalation Notes
- Legacy reference deployment: `https://employee-management-sigma-eight.vercel.app` (read-only).
- Production parity deployment: `https://employee-management-parity-9o205nrhz-granins-projects.vercel.app`.
- Coordinate credential usage (GitHub/Vercel) with the team; no direct pushes to `main` without approval.
- Log unresolved questions or blockers in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` under a new “Open Questions” sub-section if needed.

## 8. Browser Agent Walkthrough (share on handoff)
1. **Toolbar & Selection** – Tab across toolbar buttons, confirm focus styles, toggle selection mode, open/close bulk edit via Esc.
2. **Bulk Edit Skills/Reserve** – Select two rows, run add/replace/remove for primary/reserve skills (check drawer summaries reflect updates and timeline comment appears when provided). Observe the “Предстоящие изменения” summary and the “Всего” counter before applying changes.
3. **Tag Manager** – Open without selection, create a tag, close the modal, reopen (and optionally reload the page) to confirm the catalogue persists; trigger the ≥4 tag alert and confirm Esc restores focus to the toolbar.
4. **Import Validation** – For each context (Сотрудника/Навыки/Смены предпочтений/Схемы/Теги/Отпуска) upload one invalid CSV (missing header) then a valid template; confirm the heading/description reflect the chosen category, error/success toasts appear, and focus stays trapped.
5. **Export Check** – Run CSV, Отпуска, Теги exports; verify the modal heading/description match the context, downloaded files include expected headers/content, and the toast references the context-aware filename.
6. **Quick Add + Drawer** – Create a draft via quick add, confirm drawer opens, clear the email field to verify the save button disables, restore valid data, save to observe the toast, reopen to confirm persistence, and ensure VoiceOver (if available) announces headings/buttons in order.
7. **Accessibility Sanity** – With VoiceOver enabled, ensure the modals announce their titles/descriptions, Esc returns to the trigger, and live region messages read selection counts/import results. Schedule the NVDA pass and log differences alongside the existing VoiceOver notes.
