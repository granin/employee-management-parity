# Codex Session Summary – Employee Management Parity (Oct 07 2025)

## 1. High-Level Outcomes
- Environment fixed for the parity repo (`~/git/client/employee-management-parity`); Node 20.x standardised (`docs/ENVIRONMENT_FIX_TODO.md`).
- Phases 1–4 complete: selection mode + dismiss/restore parity, scheme-history readout, bulk-edit matrix with full add/replace/remove semantics, tag manager (≤4 cap), and import/export validation across Appendices 1/3/4/6/8.
- Overlay accessibility tightened: bulk edit/tag manager/column settings/import/export wired with `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby`, live results announced via `role="status"`; VoiceOver sweep logged in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
- Phase 5 stabilization underway: edit drawer saves persist via localStorage with toast/error handling, email/phone/hour-norm validation gates “Сохранить изменения”, tag catalogue survives refreshes, import/export copy/file prefixes reflect the selected context, and the bulk-edit drawer surfaces a scrollable selection list plus planned-change summary.
- Playwright suite extended (validation gating, persistence after reload, tag-catalogue retention, dynamic modal headings, bulk-edit summary, skills/reserve add/remove) and green via `npm run test -- --reporter=list --project=chromium --workers=1` (32/32 passing).
- Phase 4 task doc closed with linked evidence; Phase 5 PRD/backlog/status tables updated to reflect the new work.

## 2. Artifacts to Keep
- Documentation: parity plan, backlog/PRDs, SOPs, handoff, session summary, UI guidelines, parity report, Phase 4 task doc.
- Code/tests under `~/git/client/employee-management-parity` (bulk-edit matrix, import logic, Playwright specs).
- Desktop evidence rename (Oct 06/07 files listed in `docs/EMPLOYEE_MANAGEMENT_PARITY_PLAN.md` and Phase 4 doc) – keep for audit trail.
- Reference screenshots stored on Desktop (`~/Desktop/shots epml mamgnt/` – aliases listed in `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`).
- External manuals (CH3–CH7) remain in `/Users/m/Documents/replica/...` for future validation.

## 3. Remaining Gaps / Follow-Up
- Schedule an NVDA pass to mirror the VoiceOver log once hardware access is available.
- Capture outstanding screenshots (selection banner, dismiss/restores timeline, tag-limit alert) and link via `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`.
- Coordinate with product/backend on next module parity scope (Schedule/Reporting) and outline API integration milestones once NVDA closes.

## 4. Operational Guardrails
- Default workflow: `npm run build` → `npm run test -- --reporter=list --project=chromium --workers=1`.
- Only run `npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4174` when the repo owner explicitly asks; kill the process once manual checks finish.
- Keep Magic Prompt / Human Layer guidance for agent orchestration but no longer reference legacy `~/git/client/naumen` paths.

## 5. Next Agent Checklist
1. Review `docs/Tasks/phase-5-stabilization-and-validation-prd.md` alongside `~/Desktop/ff.markdown` for the stabilization scope.
2. Sync with product on next parity slice (Schedule/Reporting) using `docs/System/parity-roadmap.md` as baseline.
3. Produce the missing screenshots and update `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md` + parity plan once captured.
4. Plan NVDA verification and note findings in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` when executed.
