# Codex Session Summary – Employee Management Replica

## 1. High-Level Outcomes
- Environment cleaned (proxy exports removed, `npm install/build/preview` verified) and logged in `docs/ENVIRONMENT_FIX_TODO.md`.
- Employee list parity implemented: data grid, filters, selection badges, column visibility, edit drawer with required/optional sections.
- Quick-add wizard expanded to four validated steps (personal → credentials → оргструктура → summary) plus success flow.
- Top-bar utilities delivered (column picker, tag manager updating mock state, import/export guidance modals referencing appendices).
- Parity report mirrored to `docs/AGENT_PARITY_REPORT.md`; optional modules decision recorded (Photo Gallery & Performance remain demo-only).

## 2. Artifacts to Keep
- Documentation (`docs/EMPLOYEE_MANAGEMENT_PARITY_PLAN.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ENVIRONMENT_FIX_TODO.md`, `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/AGENT_PARITY_REPORT.md`).
- Code and assets under `~/git/client/naumen/employee-management` (list/drawer/wizard/top-bar updates).
- Reference screenshots (`~/Desktop/shots epml mamgnt`, `~/Desktop/Screenshot 2025-10-05 ...`).
- External knowledge sources (CH3–CH7 PDFs, CE magic prompt guides) remain untouched in original locations.

## 3. Remaining Gaps / Follow-Up
- Replicate parity-plan + handoff pattern for other demos (`employee-portal`, `forecasting-analytics`, `reports-analytics`, `schedule-grid-system`, …).
- Prepare staging GitHub/Vercel targets after stakeholder sign-off on employee slice.
- Expand backlog for scheduling/reporting modules (per CH5/CH6) once current parity stabilises.
- Manual cleanup of `~/git/client/naumen_incomplete/` still required (sandbox blocked automated removal).
- Keep CE MAGIC PROMPTS / HUMAN_LAYER guidance handy for upcoming agent orchestration.

## 4. Next Steps (General)
1. Propagate parity planning docs to the remaining demos listed above.
2. Capture scheduling/reporting requirements into follow-up parity plans.
3. Draft staging GitHub/Vercel setup (new repo + project) once the employee slice is approved.
4. Manually archive/remove `~/git/client/naumen_incomplete/` when permitted.

## 5. Notes
- Keep `~/Documents/replica` untouched; all experimental work in `~/git/client` or new repos.
- When ready to onboard agent mode, provide dedicated GitHub credentials and follow the handoff checklist.
- Documentation should live in each demo repo so agents can self-serve instructions.
