# Codex Session Summary – Employee Management Parity (Oct 07 2025)

## 1. High-Level Outcomes
- Environment fixed for the parity repo (`~/git/client/employee-management-parity`); Node 20.x standardised (`docs/ENVIRONMENT_FIX_TODO.md`).
- Phase 1–3 deliverables merged: employee list parity, selection mode, dismiss/restore, scheme-history readout, tag manager with four-tag cap, import/export validation (Теги + Отпуска), and expanded Playwright coverage.
- UI content guidelines clarified (no “демо” suffixes, no tech names in copy) via `docs/System/ui-guidelines.md` and navigation updates.
- Phase 4 scope defined (`docs/Tasks/phase-4-accessibility-and-final-parity.md`) to capture remaining accessibility + evidence tasks from the comprehensive parity report.

## 2. Artifacts to Keep
- Documentation: parity plan, backlog/PRDs, SOPs, handoff, session summary, UI guidelines, parity report, Phase 4 task doc.
- Code/tests under `~/git/client/employee-management-parity` (bulk-edit matrix, import logic, Playwright specs).
- Desktop evidence rename (Oct 06/07 files listed in `docs/EMPLOYEE_MANAGEMENT_PARITY_PLAN.md` and Phase 4 doc) – keep for audit trail.
- Reference screenshots stored on Desktop (`~/Desktop/shots epml mamgnt/` – aliases listed in `docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md`).
- External manuals (CH3–CH7) remain in `/Users/m/Documents/replica/...` for future validation.

## 3. Remaining Gaps / Follow-Up
- Run NVDA/VoiceOver sweep; document findings + fixes.
- Extend Playwright for skills/reserve add/remove and any outstanding CSV templates.
- Document non-persistence and export category limitations; prepare handoff evidence.
- Update screenshot index once new captures (selection banner, dismiss/restores, tag alerts) are produced.

## 4. Operational Guardrails
- Default workflow: `npm run build` → `npm run test -- --reporter=list --project=chromium --workers=1`.
- Only run `npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4174` when the repo owner explicitly asks; kill the process once manual checks finish.
- Keep Magic Prompt / Human Layer guidance for agent orchestration but no longer reference legacy `~/git/client/naumen` paths.

## 5. Next Agent Checklist
1. Review Phase 4 task doc + comprehensive parity report (`~/Desktop/2025-10-07_09-00_comprehensive-validation-report.markdown`).
2. Execute the accessibility sweep; log results in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and update backlog/PRDs.
3. Finish Playwright coverage + screenshot refresh, then archive any superseded Desktop reports under `docs/Archive/` with a “pre-Oct 07” banner.
