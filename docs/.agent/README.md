# .agent Documentation Hub

We keep living agent docs inside this folder. Each file has a single purpose:

- `TASKS.md` – current parity backlog, phased plans, and manual cross-references.
- `SYSTEM.md` – summary of the UI surface, data model, environments, and manual links.
- `SOP.md` – standard operating procedures for common workflows (UI changes, tests, docs, deployments).
- `INDEX.md` – quick links to other documents in `docs/` so agents know where to look.

Always read `SOP.md` and `SYSTEM.md` before starting a new slice, then update `TASKS.md` and `INDEX.md` after you land changes. EOF
